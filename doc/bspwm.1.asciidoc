Selectors
---------

Selectors are used to select a target node, desktop, or monitor. A selector
can either describe the target relatively or name it globally.

Selectors consist of an optional reference, a descriptor and any number of
non-conflicting modifiers as follows:

	[REFERENCE#]DESCRIPTOR(.MODIFIER)*

The relative targets are computed in relation to the given reference (the
default reference value is *focused*).

An exclamation mark can be prepended to any modifier in order to reverse its
meaning.

The following characters cannot be used in monitor or desktop names: *#*, *:*, *.*.

The special selector *%<name>* can be used to select a monitor or a desktop with an invalid name.

Window States
-------------

tiled::
	Its size and position are determined by the window tree.

pseudo_tiled::
	A tiled window that automatically shrinks but doesn't stretch beyond its floating size.

floating::
	Can be moved/resized freely. Although it doesn't use any tiling space, it is still part of the window tree.

fullscreen::
	Fills its monitor rectangle and has no borders.


Node Flags
----------

hidden::
	Is hidden and doesn't occupy any tiling space.

sticky::
	Stays in the focused desktop of its monitor.

private::
	Tries to keep the same tiling position/size.

locked::
	Ignores the *node --close* message.

marked::
	Is marked (useful for deferred actions). A marked node becomes unmarked after being sent on a preselected node.

urgent::
	Has its urgency hint set. This flag is set externally.


Stacking Layers
--------------

There's three stacking layers: BELOW, NORMAL and ABOVE.

In each layer, the window are orderered as follow: tiled & pseudo-tiled < floating < fullscreen.

Receptacles
-----------

A leaf node that doesn't hold any window is called a receptacle. When a node is inserted on a receptacle in automatic mode, it will replace the receptacle. A receptacle can be inserted on a node, preselected and killed. Receptacles can therefore be used to build a tree whose leaves are receptacles. Using the appropriate rules, one can then send windows on the leaves of this tree. This feature is used in 'examples/receptacles' to store and recreate layouts.
