Name
----

bspwm - Binary space partitioning window manager

Synopsis
--------

*bspwm* [*-h*|*-v*|*-c* 'CONFIG_PATH']

*bspc* 'COMMAND' ['ARGUMENTS']

Description
-----------

*bspwm* is a tiling window manager that represents windows as the leaves of a full binary tree.

It is controlled and configured via *bspc*.


Options
-------

*-h*::
	Print the synopsis and exit.

*-v*::
	Print the version and exit.

*-c* 'CONFIG_PATH'::
	Use the given configuration file.

Configuration
-------------

*bspwm* has only two sources of informations: the X events it receives and the messages it reads on a dedicated socket.

The default configuration file is '$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/bspwm/bspwmrc'.

Keyboard and pointer bindings are defined with https://github.com/baskerville/sxhkd[sxhkd].

Example configuration files can be found in the *examples* directory.

Splitting Modes
---------------

New windows are inserted in the tree as close as possible to the focused window.

There are only two splitting modes: 'automatic' and 'manual'.

The default mode is 'automatic'. The 'manual' mode is entered by sending a *preselection* message.

Example: insertion of a new node (number 4) into the given tree in 'automatic' mode:

----
              b                                   c
             / \                                 / \
            3   a              -->              4   b
            ^  / \                              ^  / \
              2   1                               3   a
                                                     / \
                                                    2   1

----
             b                                   b
            / \                                 / \
           3   a              -->              c   a

Containers
----------

Each monitor contains at least one desktop.

Each desktop contains at most one tree.

Selectors are used to select a target window, desktop, or monitor. A selector
can either describe the target relatively or name it globally.

Descriptive (relative) selectors consist of a primary selector and any number

For obvious reasons, neither desktop nor monitor names may be valid descriptive
selectors.
