## Description

`bspwm` is a tiling window manager based on binary space partitioning.

The windows are represented as the leaves of a binary tree.

## Configuration

`bspwm` have only two sources of informations: the X events it receives and the messages it reads on a dedicated socket.

Those messages are sent through the `bspc` program.

If the `BSPWM_SOCKET` environment variable is defined, it will be used as the socket path, otherwise `/tmp/bspwm-socket` is used.

The recommended way of defining keyboard shortcuts is to use `xbindkeys`.

The only way to configure `bspwm` is by sending *set* messages via the client, hence `bspwm`'s configuration file is an executable called `autostart` which lives in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/bspwm/`.

Example configurations: [autostart](https://github.com/baskerville/bin/blob/master/bspwm_autostart) and [xbindkeysrc](https://github.com/baskerville/dotfiles/blob/master/xbindkeysrc).

## Splitting Modes

There is only two splitting modes: *automatic* and *manual*.

The default mode is *automatic*. The *manual* mode is entered by sending a *presel* message.

Example: insertion of a new node (number 4) into the given tree in
*automatic* mode:

                     b                                   c
                    / \                                 / \
                   3   a              -->              4   b
                   ^  / \                              ^  / \
                     2   1                               3   a
                                                            / \
                                                           2   1
        +-------------------------+         +-------------------------+
        |            |            |         |            |            |
        |            |     2      |         |            |     3      |
        |            |            |         |            |            |
        |     3      |------------|   -->   |     4      |------------|
        |     ^      |            |         |     ^      |     |      |
        |            |     1      |         |            |  1  |  2   |
        |            |            |         |            |     |      |
        +-------------------------+         +-------------------------+

Same departure, but the mode is *manual*, a `presel up` message
was sent beforehand:

                     b                                   b
                    / \                                 / \
                   3   a              -->              c   a
                   ^  / \                             / \ / \
                     2   1                           4  3 2  1
                                                     ^
        +-------------------------+         +-------------------------+
        |            |            |         |            |            |
        |            |     2      |         |     4      |     2      |
        |            |            |         |     ^      |            |
        |     3      |------------|   -->   |------------|------------|
        |     ^      |            |         |            |            |
        |            |     1      |         |     3      |     1      |
        |            |            |         |            |            |
