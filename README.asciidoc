Name
----

bspwm - Tiling window manager based on binary space partitioning

Synopsis
--------

*bspwm* [*-h*|*-v*|*-s* 'PANEL_FIFO'|*-p* 'PANEL_PREFIX']

*bspc* 'COMMAND' ['ARGUMENTS']

Description
-----------

*bspwm* is a tiling window manager that represents windows as the leaves of a full binary tree.

It is controlled and configured via *bspc*.


Options
-------

*-h*::
    Print the synopsis and exit.

*-v*::
    Print the version and exit.

*-s* 'PANEL_FIFO'::
    Write the internal state to the given FIFO.

*-p* 'PANEL_PREFIX'::
    Start every line written to the 'PANEL_FIFO' with the given prefix.


Configuration
-------------

*bspwm* have only two sources of informations: the X events it receives and the messages it reads on a dedicated socket.

Its configuration file is '$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/bspwm/autostart'.

Keyboard and pointer bindings are defined with https://github.com/baskerville/sxhkd[sxhkd].

Example configuration files can be found in the *examples* directory.

Splitting Modes
---------------

New windows are inserted in the tree as close as possible to the focused window.

There is only two splitting modes: 'automatic' and 'manual'.

The default mode is 'automatic'. The 'manual' mode is entered by sending a *preselection* message.

Example: insertion of a new node (number 4) into the given tree in 'automatic' mode:

----
              b                                   c
             / \                                 / \
            3   a              -->              4   b
            ^  / \                              ^  / \
              2   1                               3   a
                                                     / \
                                                    2   1
 +-------------------------+         +-------------------------+

 |            |            |         |            |            |
 |     3      |------------|   -->   |     4      |------------|

 +-------------------------+         +-------------------------+
----

Same departure, but the mode is 'manual', and a *window --presel up* message was sent beforehand:

----
             b                                   b
            / \                                 / \
           3   a              -->              c   a
           ^  / \                             / \ / \
             2   1                           4  3 2  1
                                             ^
